- Scene
  - The scene is once again a comfortable living room with a little donut over the dinner table and a modern center table, a sofa to watch TV and several lamps to allow night entertainment.

### [TP3 - Game Development](tp3)

- [Checkers Game](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/checkers/game-rules.php)
  - The checkers game was implemented and joined with the scenes to give the user a confortable and great experience to play a nice game of checkers against a friend. The scene can be changed at any time providing the power of choice to the user so that the scene can be the most adaptable for the moment.
- Scenes
  - The first scene is the previous comfortable living room developed in TP1 and TP2 but with the game board, timers and auxiliar boards in the dinner table to play a nice game of checkers.
  - The second scene is a beach + bloat @bdmendes
  - The third scene is a representation of a part of the universe with several planets in their orbits. In the middle of the scene there is an asteroid which has the game board, timers and auxiliar boards on top to play a nice game of checkers.
